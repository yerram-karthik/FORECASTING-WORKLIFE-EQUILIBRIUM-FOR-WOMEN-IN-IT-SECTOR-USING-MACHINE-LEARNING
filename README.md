# FORECASTING WORKLIFE EQUILIBRIUM FOR WOMEN IN IT SECTOR USING MACHINE LEARNING

# Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate prediction model that can assess the work-life balance of women in the IT industry. By leveraging various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), we aim to identify key factors influencing work-life balance and create a reliable model for predicting it.
